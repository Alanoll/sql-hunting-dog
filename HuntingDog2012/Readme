
This folder in Windows Registry contains the information in what directories
to look for add-in definitions:

	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SQL Server Management Studio\11.0_Config\AutomationOptions\LookInFolders

That is what you can probably see there:

	%VSAPPDATA%\Addins
	%VSCOMMONAPPDATA%\Addins
	%VSMYDOCUMENTS%\Addins
	C:\ProgramData\Application Data\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins
	C:\Users\maximn\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins

To make the "Hunting Dog" plugin working with SSMS 2012 you need to copy
"HuntingDog.AddIn" file to one of those directories, e.g. to this place:

	C:\ProgramData\Application Data\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins

"<Assembly>" parameter of "HuntingDog.AllIn" should point to the location of
dll's required for the correct plugin work. Change it with regard to your
local settings (the location of "Hunting Dog" build/assemblies):

	Assembly>D:\Temp\bitbucket\hunting-dog\HuntingDog2012\bin\Debug\HuntingDog.dll</Assembly>
