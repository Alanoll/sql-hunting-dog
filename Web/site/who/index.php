				<h2>Who is behind all this?</h2>
				<p>
				
					Two people were responsible for creating and releasing Hunting Dog to the world.
				
						<h3>
							Alex Maslyukov
						</h3>
						<p>
						Alex was the creator of the original version. He is a .Net Software Developer with 10+ yearsâ€™ experience in
						the field. His professional career includes working in LG Electronics and Quest Software.
						He currently works in Melbourne, Australia.
						</p>				
						<h3>
							Maxim Novikov
						</h3>
					<p>
						Without Maxium Hunting Dog would not have been released. He finished and polished original version and also created version to support SSMS 2012.
						Maxium is all round developer with experience in both Java and .Net world.
						His track record includes working with Symantec, LG Electronics, Microsoft and VMWare. He currently works in Belleville, US
					</p>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hunting Dog was created with usability in mind. 
					Microsoft officially does not publish any API to integrate any plugins to SQL Server Management Studio.
					Moreover, they usually change the way SSMS works from version to version.
					Hence, building and maintaining this plug-in is not an obvious work and frequently requires disassembling
					and analyzing the way SSMS works.
